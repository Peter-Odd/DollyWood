Simulation of real life behaviour is often sought for as computer programs keep getting closer and closer to reality. The plan for this project is to do a small simulation of an ecosystem in a sheep pasture. The simulation will consist of several actors that are dependent of each other; sheep that eat grass, wolves that eat sheep, grass that grows and more. Many features that are not necessary but could be implemented exists, this makes the project easy to adapt to the situation and therefore open ended. The goal is to make the simulation as close to real life behaviour as possible, the content in the simulation is therefore limited to this.
