Welcome to DollyWood!

DollyWood is a sheep pasture simulation with interaction between sheep and wolves. What happens over time?, will the sheep succeed to escape the wolves or will the sheep race become extinct?

Sheep and wolves can be pregnant, and give birth to lambs respectivly wolf cubs. The animals both need food and water; sheep eat grass and wolves eat sheep.
In addition the simulation consists of grass, trees, water and sunlight. The grass and trees can grow and moulder. The clouds controls the water distribution in the world and the grass grows more when daylight and when the clouds doesn’t blocks the sun.
